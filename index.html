            <h2 id="headings">Early Life</h2>
            <p> Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long power struggle with the company's board
                and its then-CEO John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took a few Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a
                computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business
                markets. In addition, he helped to develop the visual effects industry when he funded the computer
                graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company was Pixar, which produced the
                first 3D
                computer animated feature film Toy Story (1995) and went on to become a major animation studio,
                producing over 20 films since</p><br>

            <h2 id="headings">Innovations and designs </h2>
            <p> Jobs' design aesthetic was influenced by philosophies of Zen and Buddhism. In India, he experienced
                Buddhism while on his seven-month spiritual journey,[232] and his sense of intuition was influenced by
                the spiritual people with whom he studied.[232] He also learned from many references and sources, such
                as modernist architectural style of Joseph Eichler,[citation needed] and the industrial designs of
                Richard Sapper[233] and Dieter Rams.[citation needed] According to Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak,
                "Steve didn't ever code. He wasn't an engineer and he didn't do any original design..</p><br>
